Hello,

Here you will find the files I use to set my react apps.

I'm using the following procedure to feel propely set : 

npx create-react-app name_of_my_app

cd name_of_my_app

npm i axios react-router-dom bootstrap react-bootstrap

Then I copy past the App.js file you will find in this repository.

I also add to my index.js lines 6 and 7 you will find in this repository (in order to import bootstrap).

Finally, I add the components folder in order to have my first component ready to be edited.

Enjoy,

Erwan
